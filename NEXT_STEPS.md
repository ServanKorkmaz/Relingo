# Relingo - Next Steps & Action Plan

## ‚úÖ What Was Just Fixed

1. **Buddhism Now Visible**: Added `'buddhism'` to the religion order in `src/app/learn/index.tsx`
2. **Complete Buddhism Translations**: Added all 7 Buddhism lesson translations to all locale files (English, Norwegian, Turkish)

## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Database Setup Required

### 1. Verify Database Migrations

You need to run these SQL migrations in your **Supabase SQL Editor** (if not already done):

#### Migration 0010 - User Preferences and Tracking
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/0010_user_preferences_and_tracking.sql`

**What it does:**
- Creates `user_preferences` table (notifications, dark mode, language settings)
- Creates `daily_xp_log` table (for progress charts)
- Creates `user_achievements` table (for future achievements system)
- Sets up RLS policies and triggers

**Why it's critical:**
- Settings page won't save preferences without this
- Progress charts will show no data
- Export data feature won't work properly

**How to check if applied:**
Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Tables and verify these tables exist:
- `user_preferences`
- `daily_xp_log`
- `user_achievements`

---

#### Migration 0012 - Lesson Translation Keys
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/0012_add_lesson_translation_keys.sql`

**What it does:**
- Adds `title_key` and `description_key` columns to the `lessons` table
- Updates all existing lessons with proper i18n translation keys

**Why it's needed:**
- Enables proper multi-language support for lesson titles and descriptions
- Allows lesson content to be translated automatically based on user's language setting

**How to check if applied:**
Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí lessons table and check if these columns exist:
- `title_key` (text)
- `description_key` (text)

---

### How to Apply Migrations

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the entire content of the migration file
5. Paste it into the editor
6. Click **Run**
7. Check for any errors in the results panel

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Run migrations in order (0010 before 0012)

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Optional Enhancements

### 2. Google Translate API Setup (Optional)

If you want automatic translation of lesson **content** (quiz questions, answers), you need to set up Google Cloud Translation API.

**Current State:**
- UI elements (buttons, navigation, lesson titles) are translated via i18n
- Lesson content (quiz questions/answers) are stored in Norwegian in the database
- Without API key, all lesson content displays in Norwegian

**Setup Instructions:**
See detailed guide in `TRANSLATION_SETUP.md`

**Quick Steps:**
1. Create Google Cloud account
2. Enable Cloud Translation API
3. Create API key
4. Add to `.env` file: `VITE_GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
5. Restart dev server

**Cost:** 500,000 characters/month FREE, then $20 per million characters

**Decision:** Do you want content translation or is Norwegian-only acceptable?

---

### 3. Buddhism Intro Lesson

Buddhism has 6 main lessons in the database, but might be missing an intro lesson like other religions.

**To check:**
1. Look in your database: `SELECT * FROM lessons WHERE slug = 'intro-buddhism';`
2. If missing, you may want to create one following the pattern of other intro lessons

**Example pattern:**
- Simple 5-6 questions covering basic terms
- Easy difficulty (level 1)
- Topics: Who was Buddha, what does Buddhism mean, basic concepts
